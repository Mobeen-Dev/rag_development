# rag_development

Building a hybrid RAG system with open-source tools is a fantastic way to gain control, transparency, and avoid vendor lock-in. It allows you to combine the strengths of keyword (lexical) search and semantic (vector) search for optimal retrieval.

## Core Components for Open-Source Hybrid RAG

1.  **Orchestration Framework:** To manage the RAG pipeline, connect components, and handle different retrieval strategies.
2.  **Text Splitter/Chunker:** To break down your product data into manageable units.
3.  **Embedding Model:** To convert text into numerical vectors for semantic search.
4.  **Vector Database:** To store and efficiently search vector embeddings.
5.  **Lexical Search Engine:** For keyword-based search.
6.  **Re-ranking Model (Optional but Recommended):** To refine the results from hybrid search.
7.  **Open-Source LLM:** The generative model.

## Step-by-Step Open-Source Hybrid RAG Architecture

### 1. Data Ingestion and Preparation

* **Loaders:** Use libraries to load product data from various sources (CSV, JSON, SQL databases, web pages, PDFs, etc.).
    * **Open-Source Tools:** **LangChain**, **LlamaIndex** provide a wide array of document loaders.
* **Chunking:** Split large product descriptions/documents into smaller, semantically coherent chunks. This is crucial for both vector and lexical search.
    * **Open-Source Tools:** **LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`**, **LlamaIndex's `SentenceSplitter`** or other custom chunking logic.

### 2. Hybrid Indexing (Building your knowledge base)

This is where you prepare your data for both types of retrieval.

* **Embedding Generation:**
    * **Open-Source Embedding Models:**
        * **Sentence-Transformers (Hugging Face):** Offers many pre-trained models (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5`, `GritLM/GritLM-7B`). You can run these locally or host them.
        * **Open-source models for various modalities:** Look for models that can embed text, and potentially images if you plan for multi-modal RAG.
* **Vector Database (for Semantic Search):** Store your chunk embeddings.
    * **Top Open-Source Choices:**
        * **Qdrant:** Written in Rust, highly performant, good for real-time applications, and explicitly supports hybrid search functionalities.
        * **Weaviate:** Go-based, cloud-native, strong support for schema definition, and good for combining vector search with structured data.
        * **Milvus:** Designed for massive-scale vector data, very performant, Apache-licensed.
        * **Chroma:** Lightweight, easy to get started, in-memory by default but can be persisted. Good for smaller to medium scale or prototyping.
        * **PGVector (PostgreSQL extension):** If you already use PostgreSQL, this is a very convenient way to add vector capabilities directly to your existing database. Not a dedicated vector DB, but highly practical for many scenarios.
        * **Faiss (Facebook AI Similarity Search):** A library for efficient similarity search, but it's not a full-fledged database; you'd need to manage storage/indexing yourself. Often used as a backend for other solutions.
* **Lexical Search Engine (for Keyword Search):** Index your original text chunks for keyword matching.
    * **Top Open-Source Choices:**
        * **Elasticsearch / OpenSearch:** Robust, scalable, full-text search engines with powerful querying capabilities (including BM25, TF-IDF). Increasingly, they also offer vector search, enabling a single data store for hybrid search.
        * **Solr:** Another mature, highly configurable full-text search platform.
        * **Meilisearch:** Fast, user-friendly, and lightweight search engine.

### 3. Hybrid Retrieval Logic

This is the core of "hybrid" where you combine results from both search methods.

* **Simultaneous Queries:** Query both your vector database (for semantic similarity) and your lexical search engine (for keyword matching) in parallel.
* **Result Merging & Scoring:** This is critical. You need to combine the results from both searches.
    * **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF):** A common algorithm used to combine ranked lists from different retrieval methods. It's effective because it doesn't require tuning weights and is robust to different scoring scales from the underlying search engines.
    * **Weighted Sum:** Assign a weight to the semantic score and a weight to the lexical score, then sum them up. This often requires careful tuning (`alpha` parameter in LlamaIndex).
* **Open-Source Tools for Orchestration/Retrieval:**
    * **LangChain:** Excellent for building complex RAG chains. It has built-in support for various vector stores and retrievers, and you can easily implement custom hybrid retrieval logic. Many vector stores (like Qdrant, Weaviate, Elasticsearch) directly integrate with LangChain to expose hybrid search.
    * **LlamaIndex:** Designed for connecting LLMs to custom data sources. It offers powerful indexing structures and retrieval strategies, including native support for hybrid retrieval with parameters like `alpha` to balance semantic and keyword search. It also simplifies working with structured data and knowledge graphs for more advanced RAG.
    * **Haystack (deepset.ai):** A modular framework for building NLP systems, including RAG. It has robust support for different retrievers (BM25, dense, multi-modal) and allows for flexible pipeline creation.

### 4. Re-ranking (Optional but highly recommended)

* **Purpose:** The initial hybrid retrieval might still pull in some less relevant documents. Re-ranking models take the top `N` retrieved documents and re-score them based on their true relevance to the query, typically using a more computationally intensive but accurate model.
* **Open-Source Re-rankers:**
    * **Hugging Face Transformers:** You can use cross-encoder models (e.g., `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`) which take the query and a document pair and output a relevance score.
    * **Cohere Rerank (proprietary, but excellent for comparison):** While not open-source, it's a good benchmark. You could fine-tune an open-source cross-encoder to achieve similar performance.
    * **RAGatouille (ColBERT):** A library specifically focused on making ColBERT (a powerful late-interaction retrieval model) easier to use. ColBERT is designed for highly effective retrieval and often includes re-ranking capabilities implicitly.

### 5. LLM Integration

* **Open-Source LLMs:**
    * **Llama 3 (Meta):** State-of-the-art open-source LLM, highly capable.
    * **Mixtral (Mistral AI):** Excellent performance for its size, often competitive with larger models.
    * **Gemma (Google):** Powerful, lightweight models from Google.
    * **Mistral 7B, Zephyr, Falcon, etc.:** Many smaller, specialized models are available on Hugging Face.
* **Hosting:** You'll need to run these models.
    * **Local Inference:** For testing or smaller scale (e.g., using `llama.cpp`, `Ollama`).
    * **Self-hosted on GPUs:** Using libraries like **vLLM**, **TGI (Text Generation Inference)** by Hugging Face for efficient serving.
    * **Managed platforms:** Hugging Face Inference Endpoints, AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, etc. (though these lean away from pure "open-source infrastructure").

### 6. Building the Application Layer (e.g., using Flask/FastAPI)

* Create a backend API that:
    1.  Receives the user query.
    2.  Executes the hybrid retrieval (querying both lexical and vector indices).
    3.  Performs re-ranking.
    4.  Constructs the augmented prompt with the retrieved product context.
    5.  Sends the prompt to your chosen open-source LLM.
    6.  Returns the LLM's generated response.

## Key Considerations for Product Context

* **Structured Data:** For product data, you often have structured attributes (price, color, size, brand). Ensure your RAG system can leverage these for filtering and precise retrieval. Vector databases like Weaviate excel at combining vector search with structured filtering.
* **Product ID/SKU Lookup:** Implement a direct lookup for exact product IDs or SKUs before hitting R RAG.
* **Synonyms/Aliases:** Account for different ways users might refer to products (e.g., "cell phone" vs. "mobile"). Lexical search can be enhanced with synonym lists, and good embeddings handle semantic variations.
* **Real-time Updates:** For dynamic product data (stock levels, prices), ensure your indexing pipeline can update your search indices frequently.
* **Evaluation:** Crucial for improving your hybrid RAG.
    * **Retrieval Metrics:** Hit Rate, MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank), Precision@k, Recall@k.
    * **Generation Metrics:** Faithfulness, Relevance, Groundedness (often human evaluation or fine-tuned LLM evaluators).
    * **Tools:** **RAGasaurus**, **LangChain's evaluation modules**, **LlamaIndex's evaluation modules**.

By combining these open-source tools and techniques, you can build a powerful and highly customizable hybrid RAG system for your 12,000 product data points. Start simple and iterate, gradually adding more sophisticated components like re-ranking or knowledge graph integration as needed.
